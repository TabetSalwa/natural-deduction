## Exercise 1 : Natural Deduction
The goal of this exercise is to define natural deduction for Intuitionistic and Classical logic, along with a proof of their consistency.

## Exercise 2 and bonus : Heyting Semantics
In this exercise, we were asked first to extend the construction of natural deduction with conjunction, weakening and I chose to add disjunction and quantifiers. This left me with the task of discerning free and bound variables. Then, we were asked to define the type of Heyting algebrae, evaluate formulas in such an algebra, and prove soundness of Heyting semantics.

## Exercise 3 : Reflection
The main objective of this exercise is to prove boolean tautologies with the help of our own Ltac tactic.
